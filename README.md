This repository demonstrates the theoretical definitions of Lean techniques

## 🤚🏻 Kaizen
- Building block of all Lean methods
- All incremental changes routinely applied and sustained over a long period of time
- Continuous improvement method to improve the function of an organizaiton
-       The improvements could be in:
          1. Process
          2. Productivity
          3. Quality
          4. Technology
          5. Safety

### 🤞🏻 Kaizen Blitz
- Known as "Kaizen event" or "Kaizen workshop"
- If the event is tightly defined and the scope is evident for implementation, processes can be easily changed and improved
- Teams improve processes through structured workshops

|*Kaizen*|*Kaizen Blitz*|
|--------|--------------|
|1. is a method | 1. Is a workshop or an event|
|2. Brings in incremental change|2. Brings rapid solutions when required|
|3. Standardizes, measures & compares the process|3. Plans, executes the event, decides a solution & follows it through|
|4. Is lead by management & the team|4. is lead by the management|
|5. relatively delays the process of decision making|5. accelerates the process of decision making|
|6. is a continuous improvement process|6. is a part of improving the process|
|7. In Toyota, the production cycle is resumed after the problem is identified and solved|7. In Wood Infinity Private Ltd, scraps are eliminated, work areas are reorganized, and inventory is reduced|

## 🖐🏻 Poka Yoke
- It is good to do it right the first time and even better to make it impossible to do it wrong the first time
- The prompt received to save a document before closing it

---

## ✋🏻 5S
- Set of five steps to get an organized work area
-       Sort -> Set in order -> Shine -> Standardize -> Sustain

---

## 🖖🏻 JIT (Just-In-Time)
- The technique is about producing the required units, in the required quantity, at the right time, and with the required quality
- It is used in an organization to prevent accumulation of inventory

---

## 👌🏻 Kanban
- Refers to signboard in Japanese
- Utilizes display cards to signal the movement of material between the steps of product process

---

## 🤌🏻 Jidoka
- Refers to automations with human touch and is also known as "Autonomation"
- Implements supervisory function in production line and steps the process as soon as defect is encountered

---

## 🤏🏻 Takt Time
- Max time in which the customer's demand need to be met
- Takt time equals time available divided by demand rate

---

## ✌🏻 Heinjunka
- Refers to production leveling and smoothing
- Technique to reduce waste that occurs due to fluctuation in customer's demands
